  # About the Protege Data Lab                                                                        
                                                                                                      
  The Protege Data Lab exists because truly useful data is rare—yet the frontier of AI                
  development only moves forward when high-quality data makes it possible.                            
                                                                                                      
  We understand the three core pillars driving AI: models, chips, and data. We are convinced          
  that with the right datasets—the third, underdeveloped pillar—you can push the entire frontier      
  forward. Imagine a task force explicitly focused on producing the next 100 or 1,000                 
  ImageNet-grade datasets. Where would that take AI?                                                  
                                                                                                      
  ## Our Approach                                                                                     
                                                                                                      
  The Data Lab is deeply technical but grounded in reality. We think at the margin—always             
  weighing the marginal value of a datapoint on learning and the opportunity cost of choosing the     
  wrong dataset. We treat data decisions the way an applied researcher treats resource                
  allocation: every cohort you build, every inclusion rule, every missing field has a cost. The       
  question is always: what does this next datapoint buy us, and what do we lose if we chase the       
  wrong thing?                                                                                        
                                                                                                      
  Our team of in-house experts constantly innovates to produce, repackage, and surface novel          
  datasets from existing real-world data. We aim to be the single source of truth on using            
  real-world data correctly to train and evaluate AI models.                                          
                                                                                                      
  ## What We Do                                                                                       
                                                                                                      
  **Scientific partnership for commercial opportunities.** We speak directly to foundation            
  model researchers to navigate frontier-level technical discussions.                                 
                                                                                                      
  **Building high-value datasets and data products.** Deep methodological discipline,                 
  exposure to commercial data applications, and rigorous processes create new product                 
  opportunities stemming from the lab.                                                                
                                                                                                      
  **Leading AI data research.** We maintain a presence within the broader academic community          
  through publishing cutting-edge data research, designing evaluations and benchmarks, and            
  identifying gaps in training and evaluation data today.                                             
                                                                                                      
  The lab produces the intellectual scaffolding that customers look for when navigating               
  ambiguity in data quality, data selection, medical complexity, and annotation                       
  strategy—including methodological advice, evaluation design, and guidance on safe and effective     
  use of sensitive real-world data.

⏺ Now let me commit and push these changes. The new person you added to Notion should be automatically
   fetched on the next revalidation cycle (every 60 seconds), but committing will trigger a fresh     
  deploy.
